# Huffman Coding 
This is a Huffman coding algorithm, a loseless data compression scheme. Given a text, we will compress it for you. 

There are four intermediate results to display: 
F: Display the frequency count for the characters in the text.
T: Display the key,value pairs of the nodes in the final tree in level order.
H: Display the Huffman Code table for the characters in the text.
M: The original text encoded using the Huffman Code.
