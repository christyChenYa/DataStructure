# Playing With Wheels
Calculate the steps from the initial four-digit number to the target one in a wheel. Digits ranging from 0 to 9 are printed consecutively (clockwise) on the periphery of each wheel. The topmost digits of the wheels form a four-digit integer. For example, in the following figure the wheels form the integer 8056.

Each wheel has two buttons associated with it. Pressing the button marked with a left arrow rotates the wheel one digit in the clockwise direction and pressing the one marked with the right arrow rotates it by one digit in the opposite direction. Each wheel operates independently of the others (i.e. if the first goes from 9 back around to 0, the second wheel is not affected.)

Java is used in this project.
